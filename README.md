# in-game-management-system

## Objective: 

- Build a server-side system that manages a game's in-game items (e.g., weapons, potions). This system should store item data, manage player inventory, and process transactions.

## Requirements:

- The inventory system should not allow a negative balance.
- The system should be able to handle multiple requests.
- The system should record inventory balance update history (record pre/current balance after an update).
- Easy to scale
